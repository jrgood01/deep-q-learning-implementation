# Code Summary

The `BrickBreakerGym` class defines a simple implementation of the Brick Breaker game, with a canvas where the game is rendered. The game consists of a paddle at the bottom of the screen, a ball that bounces around the screen, and bricks that are randomly scattered throughout the screen. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks on the screen by bouncing the ball off the paddle and hitting the bricks.

The class contains methods for rendering the game screen, moving the paddle, detecting collisions between the ball and the bricks, and detecting keyboard events.

The `Brick` class defines a brick object with properties of the position, size, and number of lives of the brick. It also has a method for checking if a given rectangle overlaps with the brick.

# Class Summaries

## Brick

The `Brick` class defines a brick object with the following properties:

- `x`: the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the brick
- `y`: the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the brick
- `width`: the width of the brick
- `height`: the height of the brick
- `lives`: the number of lives the brick has before it is destroyed

The class has the following methods:
- `isOverlapping(x, y, width, height)`: checks if the given rectangle overlaps with the brick

## BrickBreakerGym
The `BrickBreakerGym` class defines a simple implementation of the Brick Breaker game with the following properties:

- `res_x`: the width of the screen in pixels
- `res_y`: the height of the screen in pixels
- `canvas`: the canvas where the game is rendered
- `bricks`: an array of `Brick` objects that make up the game board
- `paddle_width`: the width of the paddle
- `paddle_height`: the height of the paddle
- `paddle_x`: the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the paddle
- `paddle_y`: the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the paddle
- `ball_x`: the x-coordinate of the center of the ball
- `ball_y`: the y-coordinate of the center of the ball
- `ball_dx`: the change in x-coordinate of the ball per frame
- `ball_dy`: the change in y-coordinate of the ball per frame
- `reward`: the current score of the player

The class has the following methods:
- `__init__(self, res_x, res_y, y_fill_proportion, brick_inlay_proportion, brick_width, brick_height)`: initializes the game board with given parameters
- `startRender(self)`: starts rendering the game screen
- `detectBrickHit(self)`: checks if the ball collides with any of the bricks and returns True if it hits any brick, False otherwise
- `flip(self)`: updates the game board with any changes and renders the updated screen
- `paddle_right(self)`: moves the paddle to the right by 2 pixels
- `paddle_left(self)`: moves the paddle to the left by 2 pixels
- `on_keyboard_event(self, key, shift_key, ctrl_key, meta_key)`: handles keyboard events and triggers paddle movements

# Method Summaries

## `Brick.isOverlapping(x, y, width, height)`

This method takes in four parameters:
- `x`: the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle to check for overlapping
- `y`: the y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle to check for overlapping
- `width`: the width of the rectangle to check for overlapping
- `height`: the height of the rectangle to check for overlapping

The method checks if the given rectangle overlaps with the brick object it is called upon. It returns True if the given coordinates and dimensions overlap with the coordinates and dimensions of the brick object, False otherwise.

## `Brick.getColor()`

This method takes no parameters and returns a list of three integers all set to zero.

## `BrickBreakerGym.__init__(self, res_x, res_y, y_fill_proportion=.5, brick_inlay_proportion=.3, brick_width=100, brick_height=20)`

This method initializes the `BrickBreakerGym` object with the following parameters:
- `res_x`: the width of the screen in pixels
- `res_y`: the height of the screen in pixels
- `y_fill_proportion`: the proportion of the screen's height to be filled with bricks
- `brick_inlay_proportion`: the proportion of the filled-in area where bricks will be placed
- `brick_width`: the width of each brick
- `brick_height`: the height of each brick

## `BrickBreakerGym.startRender(self)`

This method starts rendering the game screen on the canvas.

## `BrickBreakerGym.detectBrickHit(self)`

This method checks for collision between the ball and each of the bricks. If the ball overlaps with any brick, it reduces the number of lives of that brick by 1, increases the reward, changes the direction of the ball, and returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

## `BrickBreakerGym.flip(self)`

This method updates the game board with any changes and renders the updated screen.

## `BrickBreakerGym.paddle_right(self)`

This method moves the paddle to the right by 2 pixels.

## `BrickBreakerGym.paddle_left(self)`

This method moves the paddle to the left by 2 pixels.

## `BrickBreakerGym.on_keyboard_event(self, key, shift_key, ctrl_key, meta_key)`

This method handles keyboard events and triggers paddle movements.

# Example Usage

```python
game = BrickBreakerGym(800, 600)
game.startRender()

while True:
    game.flip()

    # Move paddle based on arrow key input
    if keyboard.is_pressed('right'):
        game.paddle_right()
    elif keyboard.is_pressed('left'):
        game.paddle_left()

    # End game if all bricks are destroyed
    if len(game.bricks) == 0:
        break
```
