# Code Summary
This Python file defines two classes, `Brick` and `BrickBreakerGym`. 

The `Brick` class has methods for initializing instance variables, detecting overlaps with other rectangles, and getting the color for a given brick. 

The `BrickBreakerGym` class sets up a game with a paddle and ball to hit bricks. It has methods for initializing instance variables, starting the game, detecting hits on the bricks, rendering the canvas, and moving the paddle based on keyboard input.

# Class Summaries

## Brick
The `Brick` class has four instance variables `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. It also has a `lives` variable which starts at 5 by default but can be explicitly set upon initialization.

### Methods
#### isOverlapping(x, y, width, height)
This method takes in four parameters which are `x`, `y`, `width`, and `height`. It checks whether the given rectangle overlaps with the current one by comparing their coordinates and dimensions. The method returns a Boolean output which is `True` if there is an overlap and `False` if there is not.

#### getColor()
This method returns a list containing 3 elements which are all 0. This method doesn't take any input parameters as it only returns a fixed set of values. 


## BrickBreakerGym
The `BrickBreakerGym` class sets up a game of brick breaker. It has instance variables for the canvas, bricks, paddle, and ball positions.

### Methods
#### __init__(res_x, res_y, y_fill_proportion=.5, brick_inlay_proportion=.3, brick_width=100, brick_height=20)
This method initializes the `BrickBreakerGym` instance variables including the canvas, bricks, paddle, and ball positions. The method takes in six parameters. `res_x` and `res_y` define the resolution of the game, `y_fill_proportion` determines how much of the y-axis the bricks fill, `brick_inlay_proportion` determines the proportion of bricks placed within the filled space, and `brick_width` and `brick_height` define the size of the bricks.

#### startRender()
This method starts rendering the canvas.

#### detectBrickHit()
This method iterates over a list of bricks, and calls the `isOverlapping` method for each brick. If the `isOverlapping` method returns `True`, it decreases the corresponding brick's `lives` by 1, increments `reward` by 1 and changes the direction of the ball. The method then returns `True` if there was a hit, else `False`.

#### flip()
This method updates the canvas by redrawing the bricks, paddle, and ball positions. It also checks if the ball hits the boundaries and changes its direction accordingly.

#### paddle_right()
This method moves the paddle 2 positions to the right.

#### paddle_left()
This method moves the paddle 2 positions to the left.

#### on_keyboard_event(key, shift_key, ctrl_key, meta_key)
This method handles the keyboard input and moves the paddle left or right based on the key pressed.

# Example Usage
```Python
game = BrickBreakerGym(res_x=400, res_y=600)
game.startRender()
```
The above code initializes a BrickBreakerGym game with a canvas resolution of 400x600 and starts rendering it. 

```Python
brick1 = Brick(50, 50, 100, 20, 2)
brick2 = Brick(150, 100, 100, 20, 3)
brick1.isOverlapping(60, 60, 50, 10)
```
The above code creates two bricks with different positions, sizes, and lives. It then calls the `isOverlapping` method for `brick1` with a given set of coordinates and dimensions. 

```Python
game = BrickBreakerGym(res_x=400, res_y=600)
game.detectBrickHit()
game.flip()
```
The above code initializes a BrickBreakerGym game with a canvas resolution of 400x600, detects any hits on the bricks, and updates the canvas. 

```Python
game = BrickBreakerGym(res_x=400, res_y=600)
game.startRender()
game.on_keyboard_event('ArrowRight', False, False, False)
```
The above code initializes a BrickBreakerGym game with a canvas resolution of 400x600, starts rendering it and moves the paddle to the right when the 'ArrowRight' key is pressed.
