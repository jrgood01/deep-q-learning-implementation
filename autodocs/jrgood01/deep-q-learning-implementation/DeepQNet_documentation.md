# DeepQNet.py Documentation

## Code Summary

This file defines a PyTorch neural network class called `Net` used for deep Q-learning. The `Net` class inherits from `nn.Module` and contains several layers including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The `Net` class takes in the following parameters:

* `input_width` - an integer representing the width of the input image
* `input_height` - an integer representing the height of the input image
* `action_set_size` - an integer representing the size of the action set
* `bw` - an optional boolean value indicating whether the input images are black and white, defaults to True
* `image_stack_size` - an integer representing the number of images stacked together to form the input, defaults to 3

The `Net` class contains a `forward` method that accepts an input image tensor and returns a resulting tensor after passing through the neural network layers.

## Class Summaries

### Net

This class defines a PyTorch neural network architecture used for deep Q-learning. The class contains the following methods:

* `__init__(self, input_width, input_height, action_set_size, bw=True, image_stack_size=3)` - Initializes a `Net` object with the given input parameters. Initializes several layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
* `forward(self, x)` - Accepts an input image tensor and returns a resulting tensor after passing through the neural network layers.

## Example Usage

### Initializing a `Net` object

```
from DeepQNet import Net

net = Net(input_width=128, input_height=128, action_set_size=4, bw=True, image_stack_size=3)
```

### Using the `forward` method

```
import torch

# Assume 'image_tensor' is an input image tensor
output_tensor = net.forward(image_tensor)

# 'output_tensor' now contains the resulting tensor after passing the input image through the 'net' neural network object
```

## Conclusion

The `Net` class defined in this file provides a neural network architecture used for deep Q-learning. It accepts various parameters and contains several layers, including convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. The `forward` method allows the input image tensor to propagate through the neural network and returns a resulting tensor.
