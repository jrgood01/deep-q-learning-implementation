# Code Summary

This Python file contains the implementation of a gym environment for reinforcement learning. The environment consists of a game with two paddles and a ball, where the goal is to hit the ball with the paddles to prevent it from hitting the boundaries. The environment is tailored to work with a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) agent that determines actions based on the current state of the system. 

The class 'Gym' initializes the environment and sets up the game with given specifications such as the width and height of the game, and the number of possible actions. It implements an abstract method for applying actions which is defined in the subclasses. The class also contains methods for updating the game state, rendering the game, and clearing the current state. 

The class 'Gym' uses the 'DeepQAgent' class to make decisions regarding actions. The 'DeepQAgent' class implements the functionality of the DQL agent, including determining the best action given a state, and updating the weights during training. 

# Class Summaries

## Gym
The 'Gym' class initializes the environment for a reinforcement learning environment. It sets up the game environment with specifications such as width, height, and number of actions. It also contains methods for updating the game state, rendering the game, and clearing the current state.

### Methods
- `__init__(self, width, height, action_set_size, render=True)`: Initializes the gym environment with the given specifications for game width, height, number of actions, and whether rendering is enabled. 
- `clear_state(self)`: Clears the current game state. 
- `applyAction(self, action)`: Abstract method for applying an action to the game environment. Subclasses should implement this method. 
- `updateState(self, training=True)`: Updates the game state by choosing an action based on the current state and given policy. If training is enabled, the weights of the agent are updated. 
- `render(self)`: Renders the current state of the game. 

## DeepQAgent
The 'DeepQAgent' class implements a DQL agent for making decisions on actions in the reinforcement learning environment. It determines the best action given a state, updates the weights during training, and keeps track of relevant histories such as state and action histories. 

### Methods
- `__init__(self, width, height, action_set_size, learning_rate=0.01, discount_factor=0.9, epsilon_greedy=True)`: Initializes the DQL agent with given specifications for game width, height, number of actions, learning rate, discount factor, and whether epsilon-greedy selection is enabled. 
- `determineAction(self, state, epsilon_greedy=True)`: Determines the best action to take given the current state of the game. If epsilon-greedy selection is enabled, a random action may also be returned. 
- `apply(self, state, action, reward, training=True)`: Applies the given action to the game environment, receives the reward, and updates the history and weights accordingly. 

# Method Summaries

## applyAction
```python
@abstractmethod
def applyAction(self, action):
    pass
```
The 'applyAction' method is an abstract method that should be implemented in the subclass. It updates the game state based on a given input action.

## updateState
```python
def updateState(self, training=True):
    log_state = self.state

    if len(self.agent.state_history) > 1:
        state = torch.stack((
            torch.tensor(self.agent.state_history[-2]),
            torch.tensor(self.agent.state_history[-1]),
            torch.tensor(self.state)
        ))
        best_action = self.agent.determineAction(state, epsilon_greedy=training)
    else:
        best_action = random.randint(0, self.action_set_size)
        if training:
            self.agent.inference_history.append(None)
    reward = self.applyAction(best_action)

    self.agent.apply(log_state, best_action, reward, training=training)
```
The 'updateState' method updates the game state by taking an action with the current policy. It chooses the best action given the current state, and updates the weights of the agent if training is enabled. 

## render
```python
def render(self):
    IPython.display.update_display(PIL.Image.fromarray(self.state, mode="L"), display_id='0')
```
The 'render' method shows the current state of the game in a displayed image.

## clear_state
```python
def clear_state(self):
    self.state = np.zeros((self.width, self.height), np.uint8) * 128
```
The 'clear_state' method clears the current game state.

## determineAction
```python
def determineAction(self, state, epsilon_greedy=True):
    inference = self.model(state).squeeze().detach().cpu()
    self.inference_history.append(inference)

    if epsilon_greedy and random.random() < self.epsilon:
        return random.randint(0, self.action_set_size - 1)
    else:
        return torch.argmax(inference).item()
```
The 'determineAction' method determines the best action to take given the current state of the game. If epsilon-greedy selection is enabled, a random action may also be returned. It first generates an inference using the PyTorch model and appends it to the inference history. It then selects an action based on the inference.

## apply
```python
def apply(self, state, action, reward, training=True):
    self.action_history.append(action)
    self.reward_history.append(reward)
    self.state_history.append(state)

    if training and len(self.state_history) == self.max_buffer_len:
        self.updateWeights()

def updateWeights(self):
    pass
```
The 'apply' method applies the given action to the game environment, receives the reward, and updates the relevant histories accordingly. If training is enabled, it updates the weights. The 'updateWeights' method is an abstract method that should be implemented in the subclass. 

# Example Usage

Here is an example usage of the 'Gym' class:

```python
# Initialize the Gym environment
my_gym = Gym(width=500, height=500, action_set_size=8)

# Update the state and render the game
my_gym.updateState()
my_gym.render()
```
